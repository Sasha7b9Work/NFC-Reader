2.3.7
I2C1 with SPI1 remapped and used in master mode

When the following conditions are met:
 - I2C1 and SPI1 are clocked
 - SPI1 is remapped
I/O port pin PB5 is configured as an alternate function output
    there is a conflict between the SPI1 MOSI and the I2C1 SMBA signals (even if SMBA is not used).

Workaround
Do not use SPI1 remapped in master mode and I2C1 together.
When using SPI1 remapped, the I2C1 clock must be disabled.
